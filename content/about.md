My name is Johny James. I am a software engineer searching for next moon shot. Interested in algorithms, linux, cli and many more. 

Follow me on [**twitter**](https://twitter.com/nu11p01n73R) to get tech retweets. DMs are open.

I work on some hobby projects duing my free time, which are hosted in [**github**](https://twitter.com/nu11p01n73R).

I used to spend a lot of time on [**stack overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3150943) answering on tags like regex python awk etc. Work these days prevent me from spending much time on the site.


I mostly work on MacOS and ArchLinux.
